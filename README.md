# Computational-Design-and-Manufacturing
Projects Completed during the ISE-510: Advanced Computational Design and Manufacturing: Introduced me to the underlying concepts behind three-dimensional geometry representations, algorithms,
and the underlying mathematical foundations, essential to solving a wide variety of problems in computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and computer-aided
engineering (CAE).
